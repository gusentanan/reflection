#A Letter to myself

##1.Patience
you're young, you have many years to execute your goals.
great things happen to those who wait, you must be willing to wait for this oppurtunity

##2.Consistency
always show up and dont forget to enjoy the process

##3.Dont forget about self-happiness
care about yourself and respect yourself as you would respect your bestfriends. 
greatness for you is not about having a perfect GPA, making a bunch of money.
greatness for you is to do great work, to have a good relationship with other and yourself.
AND to embrace the challenges, not to avoid them as potential failure.. 
REMEMBER no path worth take is straight path, any worthwhile path will be full of seatbacks
but we can handle those seatback and really benefits from them. 
so conquer that fear to take those next step, cause if you dont you will stay as you are
and thats fine .. but if you take those next step and conquer that fear even if you FAIL
you become better and thats the only way you'll find greatness.
SO the question is not "why should you push yourself??" its WHY NOT
YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO NOT ONLY BE GOOD BUT TO BE GREAT 
TO BE REALLY HAPPY, AND REALLY FULL OF LOVE  N THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO PURSUE THEM!

so recognize your fear and conquer it 
and i'll be with you every step of the way

~your friend Bagus.
